# Updating Admin Credentials

This plan outlines the steps to change the administrative credentials for the dashboard to the values requested by the user.

## Proposed Changes

### Database
- Update the existing user record in the `users` table or insert a new one if necessary.
- Use `bcrypt` to hash the new password `Gaara2001`.

### Server
#### [MODIFY] [db.js](file:///d:/professional-portfolio/server/config/db.js)
- Update the seeding logic to use `Abdo` as the username and `Gaara2001` as the default password.

### Local Files
#### [MODIFY] [password datatbase](file:///d:/professional-portfolio/password%20datatbase)
- Update this reference file with the new password for consistency.

## Verification Plan
- Run a database query to confirm the record exists.
- Provide the user with the new credentials to test login.
